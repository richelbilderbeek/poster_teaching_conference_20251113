  23481 evaluations are filled in for 5863 days activity, which
  is 23481 / 5863 = 4 evaluations per day

## Introduction

ELIXIR is an EU funded initiative with the mission to enable scientists to access and analyse life science data.
The ELIXIR Training platform provides the training to help do so.
After training, its participants are sent a link to an evaluation form,
to 'assess the quality and impact of bioinformatics training' [Gurwitz et al., 2020].
How well does that evaluation achieve its goal?

## Goal

To evaluate the ELIXIR training evaluation, by:

- (1) a literature review
- (2) comparing it to an evaluation that is created transparently with evidence-based informed decisions

## Research questions

- RQ1: What is the history of the ELIXIR evaluation questions? How were they developed? By which criteria where the best questions selected?
- RQ2: How does the academic literature relate to the ELIXIR evaluation questions?
- RQ3: Which ELIXIR evaluation questions are concluded from a fully transparent process?
- RQ4: How different are the newly suggested questions from the current ones?

## Example

`[Picture with results here]`

Searching the literature for 'using course satisfaction in evaluations'
(and sentences alike) resulted in many relevant papers.
The most important paper is a meta-analysis [Uttl et al., 2017]:
The paper concludes that there are many papers that report a link between
participant satisfaction and any metric. However, this effect vanishes
for bigger studies and/or studies with rigorous metrics.
It concludes that there is no relation between
training quality and participant satisfaction.

This means that the ELIXIR evaluation question
'What is your overall rating for the course?'
does not achieve the goal to assess training quality.

## Conclusions so far

There is only weak evidence for one out of five
mandatory ELIXIR Training evaluation questions
that it can be used to 'assess the quality and impact of bioinformatics
training'.
There is strong evidence that one question is useless.

Mandatory ELIXIR evaluation question                             |Connection to the academic literature
-----------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Have you used the tools/resource(s) covered in the course before?|None found
Will you use the tools/resource(s) covered in the course again?  |None found
Would you recommend the course?                                  |This question is suitable to assess course quality, according to the only study on this [Ang et al., 2018]
What is your overall rating for the course?                      |Many papers. A critical meta-analysis concludes that this question is unsuitable to assess course quality [Uttl et al., 2017]
May we contact you by email in the future for more feedback?     |None found
